###

<p align="left">Nebula is a minimal theme made for zen browser which adds lot of new animations, glass like blur, UI changes and more. It is inspired by glassmorphism and minimal gradients.<br><br>This is my personal userChrome which i made to personalize Zen by my own liking. ❤️<br>If some of you don't like the design choices i made, you can edit the userChrome yourself if you know how to code and if you don't, you can use chatGPT to customize it as per your preference.</p>
